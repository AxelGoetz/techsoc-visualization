# UCLU Techsoc Members Visualization
Visualizing techsoc members

## Setup
To install all of the node dependencies, run
```
brew install node
npm install
```

Then since we are using grunt, you will need to install the command line tools
```
npm install -g grunt-cli
```

Then run the following command to listen for changes in the javascript file.
```
grunt
```

(If you are part of the techsoc comittee)
Finally get the latest member csv from the techsoc drive, rename it to members.csv and place it in the data directory.

To serve the directory, make sure that you have pip installed and then run:
```
pip install SimpleHTTPServer
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

Next, simply go to http://localhost:8000 in your browser.

## Note!
Do not edit any files in the dist folder! They are autogenerated!
The files you are looking for are in the static folder.
